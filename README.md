# AWS Service Broker BOSH Release

This is a [BOSH](http://bosh.io/) release for [AWS RDS Service Broker](https://github.com/alphagov/paas-rds-broker)

This is a fork of [AWS Service Broker BOSH Release](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/aws-broker-boshrelease) written by Pivotal Software Inc.

We have removed all references to [AWS CloudFormation Service Broker](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker) and [AWS SQS Service Broker](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/sqs-broker) that were included in original repository. 


## Disclaimer

This is NOT presently a production ready AWS Service Broker BOSH release. This is a work in progress. It is suitable for experimentation and may not become supported in the future.

## Usage

### AWS credentials and permissions

This BOSH release requires an AWS user with some advanced privileges. Instead of using your primary AWS admin user, it is recommended to create a new AWS user (with the proper access keys), create an specific policy based on the [iam_policy.json](iam_policy.json) file, and then attach the policy to the user.

### Using BOSH

#### Upload the BOSH release

To use this BOSH release, first upload it to your BOSH:

```
bosh target BOSH_HOST
git clone https://github.com/alphagov/paas-rds-broker-boshrelease.git
cd aws-broker-boshrelease
bosh upload release releases/aws-broker/aws-broker-2.yml
```

#### Create a BOSH deployment manifest

Now create a deployment file (using the files in the [examples](examples/) directory as a starting point).

#### Deploy using the BOSH deployment manifest

Using the previous created deployment manifest, now we can deploy it:

```
bosh deployment path/to/deployment.yml
bosh -n deploy
```

Refer to the broker's documentation for more details about the required properties:
* [AWS RDS Service Broker Documentation](https://github.com/alphagov/paas-rds-broker/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md)

### Using [Pivotal Ops Manager](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager)

#### Pivotal tile

You can deploy the AWS Service Broker using [Pivotal Ops Manager](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager). If you want modify the configuration (services, plans, ...) you will need to build your custom Pivotal tile, otherwise, just download the already existing Pivotal tile.

```
git clone https://github.com/alphagov/paas-rds-broker-boshrelease.git
cd paas-rds-broker-boshrelease
bundle install
bundle exec vara build-pivotal .
```

##### Download the Pivotal tile
